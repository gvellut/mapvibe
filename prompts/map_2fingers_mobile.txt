I want to add the processing of a URL parameter to enable cooperative gesture in Maplibre.
- the parmeter will be called cooperativeGestures and value can be any value that can mean true or false (ie 1, y, yes, true in any capitalization)
- it will configure the maplibre instance same as the cooperativeGestures supported in maplibre. I want it to be a URL param because I want to separate the cooperativeGestures in normal mode or gesture with the same config.json
- that parameter will not be transmitted to the fullscreen action ie fullscreenBtn.onclick
